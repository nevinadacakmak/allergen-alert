AllergenAlert.co is a website built by using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It takes the user's location as input, and returns the possible allergen trees in the area by using a government data of more than 600,000 lines. 
Since the data was only available for Toronto, the website is only valid for the Toronto area.
This website is built during ElleHacks 2024, with the theme of "Seasons".
